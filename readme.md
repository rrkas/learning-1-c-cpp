# C and C++ Basics

## Intro
### C
- C is a middle-level, general-purpose computer programming language.
- C is amongst the oldest programming languages out there.

### C++
- C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

## Why C
### It is simple to understand
- C programming language uses blocks to separate pieces of code performing different tasks. 
- This helps make programming easier and keeps the code clean.

### It is used in embedded programming
- C is used in embedded programming, which is used to control micro-controllers. 
- These micro-controllers are used in robotics, computers, and automation.

### It forms the basis for C++ and Java
- Java and C++ are amongst the most widely used programming languages today. 
- They derive their syntax, and concepts from the C programming language. 
- Being acquainted with the C programming basics will thus make learning C++ and Java easier.

### It is fast
- The programs that you write in C compile and execute much faster than those written in other languages. 
- This is because it does not have garbage collection and other such additional processing overheads. 
- Hence, the language is faster as compared to most other programming languages. 
- This is one of the reasons why C is used even today for programming.

### It is used to build PC games
- C finds use in many PC games. 
- It has been used to code various small games and some tasks in bigger games as well. 

### It gives you the best of both worlds
- Low-level languages process programs faster, while High-Level languages are more user and developer-friendly. 
- The C is a mid-level language that combines the best of both. 
- It is simple to understand, easy to use, and processes programs faster.


## Why C++
### Career Opportunities
- C++ is considered as a foundation language for many languages. 
- It is one of the essential languages that you must know if you are interested in computer science. 
- There is a very high chance that every other programmer or software developer who is doing great in his life is familiar with the concepts and fundamentals of C++. 
- There are many different kinds of jobs out there that require C++ language. 
- It is a versatile language, so it remains in high demand amongst professionals, such as software developers, game developers, C++ analysts and backend developers, etc.

### C++ is an Efficient and Fast Language
- C++ is an advanced language that supports various programming methods like functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming. 
- It is a fast language; its compile-time and execution time is faster than other programming languages. 
- Some programming languages are also faster than C++. 
- Still, like C++, they are not close to the machine code, as it is an intermediary language, so big organizations rely on C++ for fast speed with lesser resources.

### Suitable for Big Projects
- C++ programming language is very well suited for big projects. 
- Many projects, including compilers, cloud storage systems, databases, game development, graphic designs, etc., are built using C++. 
- C++ is also used for making 3D visuals projects, these projects require control over huge amounts of data efficiently, and C++ is one of the best choices for that.

### Embedded Systems
- An embedded system is a microprocessor-based software and hardware system that is used to design a specific function. 
- Developing these embedded systems requires fast and efficient languages like C++. 
- C++ is widely used in embedded systems because it is an intermediary language. 
- It has both the features of the high-level and low-level language, which gives C++ an edge over other languages because it can directly access the hardware part without sacrificing the high-level part.

### Versatility
- C++ is versatile in nature and is a highly adaptable language. 
- Due to high adaptability, it is still useful when it comes to software and developing games. 
- It is widely used for so long that it is compatible with many languages and is in demand in many sectors. 
- Also, top-tier companies seek employees with a good understanding of C++ programming.

### C++ Language for Simulations
- Apart from Python, C++ is also used for simulations. 
- Many simulations are created with the help of the C++ library, which is considered an alternative to the Python language. 
- The object-oriented approach provides faster execution, full accessibility to the base language, portable models and executables, and complementary development tools. 
- The simulation built with tools has the benefits of an object-oriented design, including encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and parameterized typing.
