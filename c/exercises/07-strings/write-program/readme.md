## unsolved
1. Write a program that converts all lowercase characters in a given string to its equivalent uppercase character.
1. Write a program that extracts part of the given string from the specified position.   
For example, if the sting is "Working with strings is fun", then if from position 4, 4 characters are to be extracted then the program should return string as "king". Moreover, if the position from where the string is to be extracted is given and the number of characters to be extracted is 0 then the program should extract entire string from the specified position.
1. Write a program that converts a string like "124" to an integer 124.
1. Write a program that replaces two or more consecutive blanks in a string by a single blank. For example, if the input is  
    ```
    Grim    return   to   the   planet   of   apes!!
    ```  
    the output should be  
    ```
    Grim return to the planet of apes!!
    ```
1. Write a program that uses an array of pointers to strings str[ ]. Receive two strings str1 and str2 and check if str1 is embedded in any of the strings in str[ ]. If str1 is found, then replace it with str2.
    ```c
    char *str[ ] = {
        "We will teach you how to...",
        "Move a mountain",
        "Level a building",
        "Erase the past",
        "Make a million",
        "...all through C!"
    };
    ```
    For example if str1 contains "mountain" and str2 contains "car", then the second string in str should get changed to "Move a car".
