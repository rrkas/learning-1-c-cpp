# data structures

A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

- **Linear data structure**: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.<br> Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
    - **Static data structure**: Static data structure has a fixed memory size.<br> It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.<br> An example of this data structure is an array.
    - **Dynamic data structure**: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed.<br> It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.<br> Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.
- **Non-linear data structure**: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.<br> In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only.<br> Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.
