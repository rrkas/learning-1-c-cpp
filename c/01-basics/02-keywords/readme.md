# Keyword

These are reserved words in C and used for specific purposes

## List of keywords in C
| keyword | usage |
| - | - |
| auto | declares automatic variables |
| break | terminates the innermost loop immediately when it's encountered |
| case | defines a conditional block of code within switch statement |
| char | declares a character variable |
| const | An identifier can be declared constant by using the const keyword |
| continue | skips the statements after it inside the loop for the iteration |
| default | used to specify the default case in the switch statement |
| do | specifies `do...while` loop |
| double | declares a floating-point variable (double) |
| else | the solution for when the if condition is false and the code inside the if block doesn't run |
| enum | Enumeration types are declared in C programming using keyword enum |
| extern | declares that a variable or a function has external linkage outside of the file it is declared |
| float | declares a floating-point variable (float) |
| for | used to make a for loop |
| goto | used to transfer control of the program to the specified label |
| if | defines a if block |
| int | declare integer type variables |
| long | type modifiers that alter the meaning of a base data type to yield a new type |
| register | creates register variables which are much faster than normal variables |
| return | terminates the function and returns the value |
| short | type modifiers that alter the meaning of a base data type to yield a new type |
| signed | type modifiers that alter the meaning of a base data type to yield a new type |
| sizeof | evaluates the size of data (a variable or a constant) |
| static | creates a static variable.<br> The value of the static variables persists until the end of the program |
| struct | used for declaring a structure.<br> A structure can hold variables of different types under a single name |
| switch | allows to execute one code block among many alternatives |
| typedef | used to explicitly associate a type with an identifier |
| union | used for grouping different types of variables under a single name |
| unsigned | type modifiers that alter the meaning of a base data type to yield a new type |
| void | nothing or no value |
| volatile | used for creating volatile objects.<br> A volatile object can be modified in an unspecified way by the hardware |
| while | used to declare `do...while` and `while` loops |


**Note:**   
- compiler vendors (like `Microsoft`, `Borland`, etc.) provide their own keywords apart from the ones mentioned above. 
- These include extended keywords like `near`, `far`, `asm`, etc. 
- Though it has been suggested by the ANSI committee that every such compiler specific keyword should be preceded by two underscores (as in `__asm` ), not every vendor follows this rule.
