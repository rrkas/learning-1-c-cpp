# Variables

A variable is a named memory location.

## What does that really mean?
- Memory is divided into bits/ bytes and every bit/ byte has a unique address.
- A variable is used to reference one/ more addresses
- It stores a value in the allocated memory allowed by the declared by the datatype
- It can also change the value in that memory location at any point of time during program execution


### Analogy
- Memory: `locker room`  
    lots of lockers
- byte: `individual locker`  
    each locker has unique ID/ number
- variable: `allocated locker`  
    user has access to a locker and he can keep anything he wants at anytime in it.

## Declaration and Initialization
- **Declaration**: Declaring to compiler about a variable  
    Example: `int a;`
- **Initialization**: Assigning initial value to the variable  
    Example: `a = 10;`
- **Declaration** and **Initialization**: Declaring to compiler about a variable and simultaneously assigning a initial value to the variable  
    Example: `int a = 10;`
