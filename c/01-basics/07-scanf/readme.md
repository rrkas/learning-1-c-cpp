# `scanf`


takes a formatted input from the keyboard

## signature
`int scanf(const char *format, ...)`

`format` âˆ’ This is the C string that contains one or more of the following items:
- Whitespace character, 
- Non-whitespace character
- Format specifiers.   
A format specifier will be like `[=%[*][width][modifiers]type=]`

## options

| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `*` | This is an optional starting asterisk indicates that the data is to be read from the stream but ignored, i.e. it is not stored in the corresponding argument. |
| `width` | This specifies the maximum number of characters to be read in the current reading operation. |
| `modifiers` | Specifies a size different from `int` (in the case of `d`, `i` and `n`), `unsigned int` (in the case of `o`, `u` and `x`) or `float` (in the case of `e`, `f` and `g`) for the data pointed by the corresponding additional argument: <br>`h` : `short int` (for `d`, `i` and `n`), or `unsigned short int` (for `o`, `u` and `x`) <br>`l` : `long int` (for `d`, `i` and `n`), or `unsigned long int` (for `o`, `u` and `x`), or `double` (for `e`, `f` and `g`) <br> `L` : `long double` (for `e`, `f` and `g`) |
| `type` | A character specifying the type of data to be read and how it is expected to be read. |


| type | Qualifying Input | Type of argument |
| - | - | - |
| `c` | Single character: Reads the next character.<br> If a width different from 1 is specified, the function reads width characters and stores them in the successive locations of the array passed as argument.<br> No null character is appended at the end. | `char *` |
| `d` | Decimal integer: Number optionally preceded with a + or - sign | `int *` |
| `e`, `E`, `f`, `g`, `G` | Floating point: Decimal number containing a decimal point, optionally preceded by a + or - sign and optionally followed by the e or E character and a decimal number.<br> Two examples of valid entries are `-732.103` and `7.12e4` | `float *` |
| `o` | Octal Integer: | `int *` |
| `s` | String of characters. This will read subsequent characters until a whitespace is found (whitespace characters are considered to be blank, newline and tab). | `char *` |
| `u` | Unsigned decimal integer. | `unsigned int *` |
| `x`, `X` | Hexadecimal Integer | `int *` |

additional arguments:
-  Depending on the format string, the function may expect a sequence of additional arguments, each containing one value to be inserted instead of each %-tag specified in the format parameter, if any. 
- There should be the same number of these arguments as the number of %-tags that expect a value.

Returns: 
- On success, the function returns the number of items of the argument list successfully read. 
- If a reading error happens or the end-of-file is reached while reading, the proper indicator is set (feof or ferror) and, if either happens before any data could be successfully read, EOF is returned.
